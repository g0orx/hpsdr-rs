// 'send' copies samples from the sample stream and proactively pushes those samples to external
//	functions by calling them.  As such, the call and parameters are somewhat specific to the
//	need for the data.  Nevertheless, this code is written in somewhat of a generic form to 
//	facilitate adding additional functions in the future.
